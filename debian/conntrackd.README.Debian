conntrackd and init systems
---------------------------

The last package version which includes support for sysvinit was
conntrackd 1:1.4.4-1.

That version included some files which are now gone:
 * /etc/init.d/conntrackd
 * /etc/default/conntrackd

You should use the systemd service file located in
/lib/systemd/systemd/conntrackd.service. To customice it, copy that file
to /etc/systemd/system/conntrackd.service so updates to the package
don't destroy your changes.
